This is a simple android appliaction which is developed on MVVM Architectural design pattern by using Kotlin programming language.

By referring this application we can understand most of the modern application concepts like

MVVM
 - Its a architectural design pattern, where presentation, business and data layers are loosely coupled
   So that the application can be easily testable and maintainable(Modifiable)
 
DataBinding(no more findviewById's)
 - This library allows us to bind(injecting) views into code(one way) and binding data into views(two way),
   without having view's reference explicitly(by findViewById's).

Dagger Hilt(Annotation based)
 - Its a compile time Android based Dependency Injection framework build on top of dagger2 framework,
   If we want to make our code loosely coupled then we need to go with Manual Dependency Injection,
   but it adds a lot of extra code and time to develop. This Manual work can be automated with the help
   of DI frameworks and Hilt is one among them.

Kotlin coroutines
- Making asynchronous calls with Kotlin Coroutines

Retrofit
- REST-Client based webservices implementation with Retrofit library.

Glide
 - loading images asynchronously by using Glide library

RecyclerView
 - RecyclerView with filter option
